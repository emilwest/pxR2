 3.2.2.1 File without KEYS
 After the key word follows all data cells that belong to the table. In most cases the cells are written with one record per line in the table. The number of records will thus be determined by the number of values in the stub. The length of the records depends upon the number of values in the heading, and also upon the size of figures. Table cells that contain a dash, one, two, three, four, five or six dots should be within quotation marks. For data without keys it is possible to write all cells in just one record, terminated by a semicolon. PC-Axis accepts the delimiters comma, space, semicolon, tabulator. The different delimiters are synonyms and can be mixed in the file. Recommended delimiter is space.

 3.2.2.2 Files with KEYS 
For every variable in the stub is indicated the value for the variable within quotation marks, comma separated, followed by all data cells for that row (no quotation marks, space separated).

How the dots are shown on screen is determined by the keywords DATASYMBOL1, etc. If these keywords are missing the presentation is taken from PC-Axis language files. 3.2.2.3 Number of decimals when a file is saved The keyword DECIMALS determines the number of decimals to be saved. If the file also contains the key word PRECISION, PC-AXIS saves as many decimals as corresponds to the largest number specified by DECIMALS or PRECISION.
